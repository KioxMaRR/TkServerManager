# TkServerManager
TK Server - TCP Control & Whitelist Manager
===========================================

ðŸ“Œ Overview:
------------
This is a TCP server written in C# that:
- Manages client connections on port 5000.
- Uses an authentication system based on SteamID and Serial.
- Stores and manages the list of whitelisted users in files.
- Can send the mods list, launcher download link, and connected client count to clients.
- Provides a special remote PowerShell shell access via a secure command.
- Has an automatic game server restart scheduler using batch scripts.
- When the console is closed, it trims the whitelist.txt file to keep only the first 6 lines.

ðŸ“‚ Files and Purpose:
---------------------
- `whitelist.json` â†’ Stores full list of users (SteamID + Serial + Name)
- `whitelist.txt` â†’ List of allowed SteamIDs (for the game server)
- `modslist.txt` â†’ Active mods list (semicolon `;` separated)
- `LinkLauncher.txt` â†’ Launcher download link
- `stopserver.bat` / `startserver.bat` â†’ Scripts to stop and start the game server
- `README.txt` â†’ This documentation

----------------------------
(Type in the server console while it is running)

- `help` â†’ Show available commands
- `clients` â†’ Show the number of connected clients
- `users` â†’ List registered users from whitelist.json
- `clear` â†’ Clear the console
- `exit` â†’ Shut down the server (will clean whitelist.txt before exit)
- `setmods` â†’ Set the server mod list (separated by `;`)
- `setupdate` â†’ Save launcher link to LinkLauncher.txt
- `setrestart HH:mm` â†’ Schedule periodic restart (example: `setrestart 01:30` = every 1h 30m)
- `cancelrestart` â†’ Cancel scheduled restart
- `nextrestart` â†’ Show the next scheduled restart time

ðŸ”Œ Client Protocol & Messages:
------------------------------
After connecting, clients must first send their version:
Server responds:
- `VERSION_OK` â†’ Version matches
- `UPDATE_REQUIRED` â†’ Version is outdated

Client commands to the server:
- `GET_Link_Launcher` â†’ Get launcher link from LinkLauncher.txt
- `REQUEST_SHELL_[TK]KIOXMAR` â†’ Request remote PowerShell shell access (requires password)
- `GET_COUNT` â†’ Get the number of connected clients
- `GET_MODS` â†’ Get the server mods list
- `{SteamID}|{Serial}|{Name}` â†’ Register or log in the user

ðŸ”‘ Remote Shell Access:
-----------------------
- Only accessible with the fixed password `Z@5g!7pL*mXv2#eFKR`
- After authentication, allows executing PowerShell commands directly on the server.
- Exit shell mode by typing `exit`

âš  Security Notes:
-----------------
- This server allows remote command execution on the host machine. **Strongly recommended** to use only in a secure environment with trusted clients.
- For public use, change the password and port, and implement TLS encryption.
